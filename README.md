# Lab3-Shell
A git repository for students


## First steps

### Create
Create new file with your name (use whatever you want for the extension), and add a proper commit change name.

These steps are equivalent to:
```git

# Local changes

# Add the file
git add your_file
# Apply locally the change
git commit -m "Your message"


# Remote changes since it is a remote repository

# Get all the changes between your version and the remote's version
git pull
# Apply changes in the remote repository
git push
```

### Delete

Delete a file (the one you want).

This step is equivalent to:
```git

# Local changes

# Remove the file
git rm your_file
# Apply locally the change
git commit -m "Your message"


# Remote changes since it is a remote repository

# Get all the changes between your version and the remote's version
git pull
# Apply changes in the remote repository
git push
```


## Get an older version

Let's start the lab!

Oh no! Something went wrong! The first exercise is missing.
It must have been deleted due to inattention.
It must be found in an earlier version.
If the commit was well done, a good name was chosen!


Find it! And hurry up, the time goes by!
