# Lab3-Shell
A git repository for students

## The first exercice

Keep going! The first exercise is a reminder of what has been done so far in Shell.

### Connection
Firstly, (as usual) we must connect to the website <https://replit.com/languages/bash>

### Move through the file tree structure

The objectif is to find where the command *mv* is located (using only the learned commands).
A hint to start the exercice, command are really often in a *bin* directory. 

<details><summary>Hint #1</summary>

If you are on *replit* website:
  You should look at the root!

If you are on you own computer:
  You should look at the root or in */usr* repository!
</details>

#### NB
Instead of browsing the whole tree, there is a command to display the absolute path of the searched command: **which *your_command***
Try:
```shell
which mv
```
It looks like that the command is also in another directory

### Let's do something now

Now, move back to your home directory then copy the command inside a folder named *tmp*.

<details><summary>Hint #1</summary>
The home directory is the variable $HOME, or the shortcut ~
</details>

<details><summary>Hint #2</summary>
You must create the directory *tmp* before copying the command
</details>

<details><summary>Hint #3</summary>
To create a directory: mkdir *directorys_name*
To copy a file: cp *path_source* *path_destination*
</details>


### Wrong path!

Oh no! It seems that the next exercise is on the branch *scripting*.
Let's check the branch to find the rest of the exercise.
